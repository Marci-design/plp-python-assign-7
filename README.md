**Data Analysis Assignment**
**📌 Objective**

The purpose of this assignment is to:

Load and explore a dataset using the pandas library in Python.

Perform basic data analysis tasks (e.g., checking structure, summary statistics, missing values).

Create simple visualizations using the matplotlib library to better understand the data.
├── sales.py/             # Dataset(s) used in the analysis
├── README.md             # Project documentation

**⚙️ Requirements**

You will need the following Python libraries installed:

pandas

matplotlib

numpy 

You can install them using:
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy jupyter

**🚀 Steps in the Analysis**

** 1.Data Loading**

Imported the dataset using pandas**.read_csv() **(or another suitable function).

Displayed the first few rows with **.head().**

** 2.Data Exploration**

Checked dataset shape using .shape.

Looked at column names and data types with **.info().**

Examined summary statistics using**.describe().**

Checked for missing values using **.isnull().sum()**.

** 3.Basic Data Analysis**

Found insights such as averages, counts, min/max values, or correlations.

** 4.Visualizations**

Created at  charts using matplotlib.pyplot, for example:

Histogram of a numeric column.

Bar chart of category counts.

Line chart showing trends.

Summarized key insights discovered from the data.

**📝 Conclusion**

This assignment helped practice:

Working with datasets in** pandas.**

Performing exploratory data analysis.

Building simple yet effective visualizations with **matplotlib.**
